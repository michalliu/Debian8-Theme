A proposal for a new approach for Debian 8

How to install
--------------

Install a bare (I mean really bare, use a netinstall disc and untick everything when asked to install composants) Debian Wheezy.
While root, edit the sources.list file to "testing" (Jessy).
Install the ca-certificates packages, and use wget to grab the install script:

Make the script executable, and launch it !
